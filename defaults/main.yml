  # To avoid seeks ZooKeeper allocates space in the transaction log file in
  # blocks of preAllocSize kilobytes. The default block size is 64M. One reason

  # Clients can submit requests faster than ZooKeeper can process them,
  # especially if there are a lot of clients. To prevent ZooKeeper from running
  # out of memory due to queued requests, ZooKeeper will throttle clients so that
  # there is no more than globalOutstandingLimit outstanding requests in the
  # system. The default limit is 1,000.ZooKeeper logs transactions to a
  # transaction log. After snapCount transactions are written to a log file a
  # snapshot is started and a new transaction log file is started. The default
  # snapCount is 10,000.
